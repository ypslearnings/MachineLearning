# Machine Learning Code Repository

This repository contains Python code for various machine learning projects. 

## Cab Booking System

The "Cab Booking System" project deals with predicting the availability and estimated time of arrival (ETA) of cabs for a given location. The project's subfolder includes the following files:

- `cab_booking_system.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook file contains the Python code for training a machine learning model that predicts cab availability and ETA. The notebook provides detailed explanations and comments to help you understand and modify the code as needed.

- `data/`: This directory contains the dataset used for training and evaluating the cab booking system model. Be sure to follow the instructions within the notebook to properly set up the data before running the code.
